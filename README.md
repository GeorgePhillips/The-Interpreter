# Welcome to The Interpreter

This is simple open source properties file validator built with electron.

## Using the app

The app consists of two screens:

- Input screen - paste in your properties file or choose a file
- Output screen - this will show you if you have any warnings and present you with a sorted properties file.

## Building the app

```bash
npm install

npm start
```

## Contributing
